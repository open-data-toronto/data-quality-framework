# Open Data Toronto: Data Quality Score (DQS)

This is the code behind the DQS, so we can share how the score is calculated. The goal of the DQS is to geive users an idea of how good data is without having to view it and give publishers pointers for improving their data - and an incentive to create _better_ datasets, not just _more_ of them.

> High quality data enables high-quality impact

Although a high-level overview of the DQS is provided throughout the notebook, it is highly recommended to read the articles where we share in detail why the DQS was created and how (beyond the code):
